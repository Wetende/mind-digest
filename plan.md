## Real Implementation Plan (no mocks)

This plan replaces all mock/demo logic with real, secure, observable, and scalable implementations. Use the checkboxes to track progress. Phases are ordered; items within a phase can run in parallel unless dependencies are noted.

### Conventions
- Environments: `dev` → `staging` → `prod`
- Backend: Supabase (DB, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- Client: Expo React Native app
- Secrets: Never in client; only in server/Edge Functions
