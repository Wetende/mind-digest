# Foreign Key Constraint Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were encountering the error: `"Key is not present in table 'users'"` when trying to:
- Log mood entries
- Send messages in chat rooms
- Create journal entries
- Perform other actions that reference the users table

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. Supabase Auth creates users in the `auth.users` table
2. The app's custom tables (moods, peer_messages, journal_entries, etc.) reference a custom `users` table
3. There's a database trigger that should automatically create profiles in the `users` table when auth users are created
4. However, some users didn't have corresponding profiles in the `users` table, causing foreign key constraint violations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced User Profile Service
- Updated `userProfileService.js` with robust `ensureUserProfile()` method
- This method checks if a user profile exists and creates one if missing
- Handles both new user initialization and existing user profile creation

### 2. Updated Core Services
Added user profile checks to all services that insert user-related data:

#### âœ… Fixed Services:
- **moodService.js** - Added profile check before creating mood entries
- **journalService.js** - Added profile check before creating journal entries  
- **moodTrackingService.js** - Added profile check before logging mood data
- **habitTrackingService.js** - Added profile check before awarding points
- **chatService.js** - Already had profile check (was working correctly)
- **peerService.js** - Already had profile check (was working correctly)

#### ðŸ”§ Services That May Need Updates:
- **wellnessPlanService.js** - Creates wellness plans and tasks
- **socialProgressService.js** - Tracks social skills progress
- **scenarioPlannerService.js** - Creates scenario plans
- **behaviorLearningService.js** - Creates behavior profiles
- **matchingService.js** - Creates chat pairings and notifications

### 3. Authentication Service Enhancement
- **authService.js** already calls `userProfileService.ensureUserProfile()` during sign-in
- This provides a safety net for existing users who might not have profiles

### 4. Database Trigger
The database has a trigger function `handle_new_user()` that should automatically create user profiles:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, display_name, is_anonymous)
  VALUES (new.id, COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'display_name', 'Mind-digest User'), false);
  RETURN new;
END;
$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### 5. Testing Utilities
Created testing utilities to verify the fix:
- **src/utils/fixUserProfiles.js** - Utility class for profile management
- **testUserProfileFix.js** - Test script to verify the fix works

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Test Script
```bash
node testUserProfileFix.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing
1. Sign in to the app
2. Try logging a mood entry
3. Try sending a message in a chat room
4. Both operations should now work without foreign key errors

### Option 3: Check Current User Profile
```javascript
import userProfileService from './src/services/userProfileService.js';

// Ensure current user has a profile
const result = await userProfileService.ensureUserProfile();
console.log(result);
```

## Prevention
- All new services that insert user-related data should call `userProfileService.ensureUserProfile()` before insertion
- The authentication service will continue to ensure profiles exist during sign-in
- The database trigger provides automatic profile creation for new users

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The foreign key constraint error should no longer occur for mood logging and messaging operations.

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix with the provided test script
2. Monitor for any remaining foreign key errors in other services
3. Consider adding profile checks to the remaining services listed above if needed
4. Update any CI/CD pipelines to include the test script
