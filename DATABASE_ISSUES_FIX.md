# Database Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Tables (404 Errors)
- `user_behavior_data` table doesn't exist
- `user_behavior_profiles` table doesn't exist

### 2. Permission Issues (406 Not Acceptable Errors)
- `users` table query failing
- `user_habit_stats` table query failing  
- `user_badges` table query failing

## Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Database Setup**: The `supabase-setup.sql` file contains the table definitions, but they may not have been executed on your database.

2. **RLS Policy Issues**: The 406 errors suggest Row Level Security (RLS) policy problems where the user doesn't have proper permissions.

3. **Missing User Profiles**: Some operations fail because user profiles don't exist in the `users` table.

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Error Handling in Services

1. **behaviorLearningService.js** - Added comprehensive error handling:
   - Checks if tables exist before querying
   - Ensures user profiles exist before operations
   - Graceful fallbacks when tables are missing

2. **Core Services** - Already fixed in previous update:
   - moodService.js
   - journalService.js  
   - moodTrackingService.js
   - habitTrackingService.js

### üîß Database Setup Required

You need to ensure your database has all required tables. Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'users', 
  'user_behavior_data', 
  'user_behavior_profiles',
  'user_habit_stats',
  'user_badges',
  'habit_activities'
);
```

If any tables are missing, you need to execute the full `supabase-setup.sql` file.

### üõ°Ô∏è RLS Policy Issues

The 406 errors suggest RLS policy problems. Check if your user has proper permissions:

```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('users', 'user_habit_stats', 'user_badges');
```

### üîÑ Immediate Workaround

The app will now gracefully handle missing tables and continue functioning. The behavior learning features will be disabled until the database is properly set up, but core functionality (mood logging, messaging) will work.

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor, run the full supabase-setup.sql file
   ```

2. **Verify Tables Exist**:
   ```sql
   \dt public.*
   ```

3. **Test User Profile Creation**:
   ```bash
   node testUserProfileFix.js
   ```

4. **Check RLS Policies**:
   - Ensure your user can access the tables
   - Verify auth.uid() is working correctly

## Status

‚úÖ **Error Handling Fixed** - App won't crash from missing tables
‚úÖ **Core Functionality Protected** - Mood logging and messaging work
‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Setup Needed** - Some advanced features require full database setup

The app should now run without crashing, but you'll need to complete the database setup for full functionality.
